Hello!

As a final project for SheCodes' React Workshop it was proposed to develop a desktop dictionary. The app I developed returns as a result the meaning, phonetics, pronunciation and images of the word the user searched for. 

Check the demo here: https://gifted-archimedes-99fd5a.netlify.app/

Languages/Framework: HTML5, CSS3, REACT.js, API.
